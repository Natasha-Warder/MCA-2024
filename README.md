### Task 3 - Challenges 

1. Working With Music & Music-Related Data 
   - Access to Music-related data is common as digitised files require proper accreditation. Curating copyrighted music (audio files, sheet music) becomes more challenging as works may be harder to access.
   - Music data distribution can become inaccurate through secondary sources, therefore it is important to source metadata from reliable sources. 

2. Theme & Emphasised Challenges
   - Discussing sound beyond structured melodies: reverb, synth and bass.
   - deconstructing authourship and proper accreditation.
   - defining ownership and gathering concise information.
   - plotting notes accurately based on proximity and scale.
     
3. Theme & Manifestations of Data 
   - Present curation takes many forms: sheet music, vocal covers, instrumental covers and thematic analysis. The lyricism and sampling of contrasting sounds have been discussed extensively by journalists over Kanye's acceptance of the media's perception of him.
   - As there is a lot of avaiable information for this dataset, it is important to ensure data is factually correct when utilising a scope of sources.

Selected Piece: All Of The Lights: Interlude (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)

Evaluating transcription by the OMR engine: 
Dotted half notes had to be fixed as the computer mistook the shape of dots as artefacts. 
The scale of the PDF is accurate, therefore poor photo quality did not impact machine ability to identify straight lines. 
When playing the song, bar lines had to be adjusted as rests were misplaced, which created inaccuracies in rhythm. 

During the group activity on tuesday, inaccuracies were found in performance methods. The piece is structured using a two staff format, whereas All of The Lights uses a bass clef for violin to accompany a treble clef and bass clef for piano. Although less instrumentation was notated, QMR engine completely removed vital information like fingerings, time signature, the composer and title. This was an unexpected outcome as accompaniment involves ensuring the cohesive nature accross different instruments.
