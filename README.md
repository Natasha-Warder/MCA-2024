### Task 3 - Challenges 

1. Working With Music & Music-Related Data 
   - Access to Music-related data is common as digitised files require proper accreditation. Curating copyrighted music (audio files, sheet music) becomes more challenging as works may be harder to access.
   - Music data distribution can become inaccurate through secondary sources, therefore it is important to source metadata from reliable sources. 

2. Theme & Emphasised Challenges
   - Discussing sound beyond structured melodies: reverb, synth and bass.
   - deconstructing authourship and proper accreditation.
   - defining ownership and gathering concise information.
   - plotting notes accurately based on proximity and scale.
     
3. Theme & Manifestations of Data 
   - Present curation takes many forms: sheet music, vocal covers, instrumental covers and thematic analysis. The lyricism and sampling of contrasting sounds have been discussed extensively by journalists over Kanye's acceptance of the media's perception of him.
   - As there is a lot of avaiable information for this dataset, it is important to ensure data is factually correct when utilising a scope of sources.


# Week 2

Selected Piece: All Of The Lights: Interlude (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)

Evaluating transcription by the OMR engine: 
Dotted half notes had to be fixed as the computer mistook the shape of dots as artefacts. 
The scale of the PDF is accurate, therefore poor photo quality did not impact machine ability to identify straight lines. 
When playing the song, bar lines had to be adjusted as rests were misplaced, which created inaccuracies in rhythm. 
Elements remained fairly consistent as the piece does not specify expression or dynamics but the metronome marking 70 beats per minute remained the same. As the piece of music has been adapted as an interlude, lyrics are excluded from the piece but this could have contributed to poor transcription. 

During the group activity on tuesday, inaccuracies were found in performance methods. The piece is structured using a two staff format, whereas All of The Lights uses a bass clef for violin to accompany a treble clef and bass clef for piano. Although less instrumentation was notated, QMR engine completely removed vital information like fingerings, time signature, the composer and title. This was an unexpected outcome as accompaniment involves ensuring the cohesive nature accross different instruments.

### Comparing MusicXML and MEI elements 

#### Note element
for MusicXML the <note> element includes attributes like <pitch>, <duration>, <type>, and <accidental>. It is designed to represent musical notes, specifying pitch and rhythmic values clearly. Whereas, for MEI The <note> element in MEI is more flexible, using attributes like pname, oct, and dur. MEI also supports richer metadata for notational details.

#### Part element
for MusicXML the <part> element contains a sequence of measures and is used to delineate different voices or instruments in a score. Whereas, for MEI The <staff> element in MEI may have multiple measures and can include additional context about the performance, instrumentation, and more.

#### Measure element
for Music XML the <measure> element contains <attributes> and <note> elements, clearly outlining the structure of the music, including time signatures and key signatures. Whereas for MEI, a <measure> is also a container for <note> elements and can include <attributes>. However, it uses a more abstract approach for structural elements, allowing for varied representations.
